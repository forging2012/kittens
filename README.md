# kittens

An IRC bot written in Go. I just recently started rewritting kittens in Go, so it lacks a lot of features currently. If you want a working version of my IRC bot checkout my CoffeScript bot on the master branch in this repository. This branch will be merged into master and takeover the master branch when it is ready. It is currently still in early development.
